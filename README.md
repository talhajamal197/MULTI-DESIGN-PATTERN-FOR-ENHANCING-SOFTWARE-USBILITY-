# MULTI-DESIGN-PATTERN-FOR-ENHANCING-SOFTWARE-USBILITY-
In order to maximize a softwareâ€™s usability. More concentration should be given to user interfaces. New design patterns are required to provide alternative functionality in case something becomes unresponsive. User never likes handling errors no matter how experienced he/she is with handling errors. The idea is to amalgamate various user-interface design patterns in order to increase responsiveness, and ease of use of the software, in addition to making in learnable, thereby enhancing its usability. Some existing user interface design patterns are lazy registration, forgiving format, clear primary actions, now joining these ideas with some behavioral design patterns like strategy, structural patterns like bridge. We will be coming up with a new design pattern guaranteed to increase user experience  and satisfaction.
